Description:
">cardrunner" is a React app that pulls data from https://netrunnerdb.com/api/doc and makes it accessible to users. At its core, the app allows users to navigate the cards that make up the base Netrunner game. It comes from a deep appreciation for the game itself and the community that keeps it alive and strong online. Version 1.0 functions as a way for people who are interested in the game to familiarize themselves with the base game before diving into the full game.

Technologies used:

User stories:
As a user, I want to find a card by its name so that I see the card.
As a user, I would like to click on an individual card to see more details about it so that I can decide if I want to include it in my deck or collection.
As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate to the results of my search, the home page, and cards Iâ€™ve recently searched so that I can find where I want to be on the site from any place.

Unsolved problems:
Individual cards are not yet clickable.

Major Hurdles:
The API I chose was fairly straight-forward, with fewer features than the ones I'd had previous experience with. Due to this, I had to rethink my approach, and narrow the scope of my project in order to get it off the ground. However, I've since built for myself some of the functionality that I was expecting to find in the API, so I expect I can take this project further from here.
